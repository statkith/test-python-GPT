 The phone is a little bit more complicated than it was in the 1980s.  The problem with the feature is that it’s not a good idea to have too many features.  The Nokia N900 is a great phone, but it’s not the best phone on the market.   the phone with a small number of features is not complex, but the phone with a hugenumber of features is.  The DVD player is a great product, but it’s not the best.
