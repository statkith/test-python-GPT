1.1 What is UX?



User experience is the process of designing a product, system or service that makes users feel good about using it.



It’s not just about making people happy; it’s also about helping them understand what they are doing and why.



So how do we make sure our UX design is user-friendly? Well, there are three main things to consider:



1) How can we make
&&


User experience is about how you feel when using a product. It’s not justabout what it feels like to use the product, but also how you feel when doing so.
&&
 I’m not sure what to do. I don’t know if this is a good idea or not.

I have been using the app for about 2 weeks now and it has been very helpful in my life, but I am still unsure of how to use it. It seems like there are some things that can be done better than others, but I don't know if they will work out well for me personally or whether
&&


Functional Design: The design that is designed to work with the user. It’s not a design you can just put on your website and expect it to work. You have to understand what the user wants, how they interact with it, and then make sure that you deliver those features in a way that makes sense for them.

Aesthetic Design: Aesthetics are about making things look good so people will want to
&&


Functional design is the process of designing a product to do what itis designed to do. It's not just about how much power you can get out ofa car, or how fast it goes from 0-60mph. It's also about how well thatcar will perform in real life - and whether its going to be funto drive.
&&
 Design is about the experience.

Designers are often asked to design for a specific audience, and they’re often asked to do so in a way that makes sense from their perspective. But what if you want to create something that appeals to everyone? What if you want your product or service to be universally accessible? How can you make it easy for people who don’t have access but still need help with the process of designing

 The car is a great tool for creating the experience of driving.

The Car Is A Great Tool For Creating The Experience Of Driving



I’ve been using my new 2015 Honda Civic for about two months now and I’m really enjoying it. It has a lot of features that make it easy to use, but also makes it very practical and fun to drive. Here are some things I like:

 Experience design is a process that starts with the customer. It’s not about designing for the sake of it, but rather to create an experience that makes customers feel good about their purchase.

I think this post has been helpful in understanding how I approach my work and what I see as important to me in terms of learning from others.
&&
 Design is a process of creating something that’s not there yet.

The design process starts with the idea, which is usually an abstract concept or vision. The idea can be about anything from a new product to a new way of doing business. It could be about how you want your company to look and feel, or it could be about what you want people to think when they see your products. Whatever the case may be, it

UX is a problem solving discipline. It’s not enough to just design great products, you need to have good UX practice in orderto create great products.
&&

----------------------------
1.2 Why experience matters

 Blackberry 10 is a great phone, but it’s not the best.

The first thing to note about this design is that it has no physical buttons on the back ofthe phone. This means that you can use your fingers to control the functions ofyour Blackberry smartphone without having to press any buttons at all. The second thingto note is that there are no physical controls for volume and power management inthis design - meaning you
&&
 the Blackberry Hub is a new way of presenting your communications, and it’s not just for theblackberry.

The phone has a lot to offer in terms of design, but there are some things that you might want to know about beforeyou buy one.




&&
 Blackberry 10 is a flop.

The Blackberry 10 was supposed to be the phone that would bring back the old days ofBlackBerry, but it failed miserably. It's not just because of its design - it's alsobecause of its price tag. The phone costs $300 and has a 5-year contract with Verizon Wireless, which means you can't buy one for less than $500 (or more if you want).
&&
 the phone was a failure because it didn’t have a home button.

The problem with the design of the iPhone is that it doesn’thave one. The designers had to come up with an entirely new way todo things, and they did so by creating something completely different from whatwas already available on other phones. This is why I think Apple should be ashamedof themselves for not having made this decision sooner: if they
&&
 I’m not saying that we should be selling phones to people who don’t want them. I’m just saying that if you are going to sell a phone, it shouldn't be the case that you're trying to make money off of someone's emotions.

I think this is an important point because there are some people out there who will buy a phone and then immediately turn around and say "Oh, I can
&&


The key points from this example are:    Great products need all three types of design. If your team or organisation is relying on functional and aesthetic design alone, you are being exposed to the same risk of failure as the Blackberry 10. The two types of design on their own are not enough because they don’t have a multiplier effect. In other words one negative experience can outweigh many positive ones. Because people tend to
&&
 Design is a process of creating an experience that makes you feel good.

Designers are often asked to create experiences that make them feel good, and the best designers do this by making their work fun. Designers can also use design as a way to communicate with customers about what they want in their products or services. The more people who know how to use your product, the better it will be for you!
&&

----------------------------
1.3 UX is a state of mind

 UX is about making sure that your customers are happy.

UX is not about money. It’s about being able to make a good product, and having the right state of mind to do so.
&&
 IKEA is a great place to buy furniture, but it’s not the Ritz.
&&


The owners are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean, the breakfast is great and the location is perfect for a day trip to London. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a relaxing stay in an old house with lots of character.
&&


I’m a designer. I love design and I love to create things that people want to use, but don’t have the money or time for.

I also like to think of myself as an entrepreneur who is trying to make my business work better by creating products that are useful and fun for me, not just for customers.
&&
 I’m a UX designer and I love the idea of designing for people.

I love the idea of designing for people because it makes me feel good about myself, and it makes me feelgood about my work. And that’s why I do this course: to help you design better software, so thatyou can be more successful in your job as an engineer or architect or whatever.
&&


The airlines are investing in UX design.

They're not just doing it for the sake of it, they're doing it because they think that's a good thing to do.




&&
 If you’re not using a good product, your customers will be less happy.

The problem with this is that the more we spend on our products and services,the more we lose out to competitors who are spending much less time thinking about what theyneed to do in order to make their software better. And if we don’t understand howto design these features or how to improve them, then it becomes very difficult for us
&&

----------------------------
1.4 Product integrity



UX designers are responsible for creating a great user experience.

The UX designer is responsible for making sure that the users of an organisationcan have a good experience with their product.




&&


The product is not a good fit for the stakeholders.



This is why we need to have a clear understanding of what our stakeholders are lookingfor, and how they’re going to be able to work with us in orderto get that product into their hands.



So let's look at some examples:



1) The Product Owner - This person has no idea about the design orthe features of
&&


Hailo is a taxi app that allows you to hail a cab from anywhere in the world. It’s free, and it works great. But there are some problems with this app:

1) The user interface is very cluttered and confusing. You can see all of your friends’ profiles on one screen, but not yours. And if you want to know who was driving the car when someone else drove it
&&


I love this app. I’ve been using it for a few months now and I’m very happy with the results. It works great, is easy to use, and has lots of features that make it really useful.



The only thing I would change about the app is that you can’t order a taxi right now - but if you want to do so in the future, just press “
&&


The app is a great idea, but it’s not perfect. It doesn’t do everything that you want it to do. And the fact that there are so many features and options makes it hard for people to use the app in a way that they think will be best for them.
&&


The app is a great idea, but it's not perfect. It needs to be more user-friendly and less confusing for the drivers.
&&
 The product is a good idea, but it’s not the right one for your business.

The next video will show you how to create an experience that fits your company and its needs.
&&
 The goal of this project is to create a new type of vehicle that can be used in the field.

The first step was to develop an open source platform for developing and deploying autonomous vehicles. The platform will allow users to build, test, deploy and manage their own autonomous vehicles. This allows them to use the technology without having to pay for it or have any technical knowledge about how it works. It also allows them to share data with other
&&

----------------------------
1.5 Product desirability



The experience designer is responsible for the product’s design, and it has to bebuildable.

Feasibility refers to the time frame of when we can expect a product tobe built. If not by us, then by somebody else who will build it. Andit has got to be built at a price that makes it viable, and ina timeframe that’s reasonable.

The second thing you need to know about the iPod is that it's a very good product, but not onethat people want to use.

Archos was a great company, but they were not able to make the product that people wanted.
&&
 I'm not sure if I'd recommend this to anyone, but it's a good way to get music from your PC onto the Jukebox 6000.

I've been using my Archos 6 for about 2 months now and have had no problems with it at all. It works great on my Windows 7 computer (which is running Vista) and has worked flawlessly since day one.



The only thing that I would say is
&&


If you can't solve the problem, then don't make it.



The second priority is to identify whether there are any potential problems that your productcan help resolve - does anybody need it? This is the most basic requirement.



And finally, if you can’t solve the problem, then don’t make it.


&&


The Archos is a great product, but it’s not solving the problem. It’s just an example of how to solve a problem in functional terms.



I think that this is what we should be looking for when we are trying to make something better than the current state of things. We have to look at our products and ask if they are actually solving the problem or if they are just making us feel
&&

----------------------------
1.6 Making a business case

 UX is about communicating the benefits of design.

UX Designers are often asked to communicate what they’re doing, and howthey’re doing it. They need to be able to explain why their workis important, and what they hope will happen when they do it. And that’swhy UX designers have a lot more experience than most otherdesigners in this field: They know how to communicate the benefits of design
&&


1. The business benefits of your project are:

2. Your customers will be satisfied with the outcome of yourproject, and they will be happy to pay for it.




&&


The business is trying to increase revenue by increasing the number of customers it has. The cost of doing so is that they have to spend more time on customer service and marketing, which will lead them to lose some customers.

So what do you think?

&&


The Mozilla team tried to answer every customer support question they could. They did this by asking questions like: "What is the best way to get help?" and "How do I contact you if I have a problem with my browser or software?". The answers were always good, but there was one thing that didn't make sense for them. It's not clear what it was, but it seemed like something that would be useful in their business

Estimate how much you will spend on the project. Estimate howmuch additional revenue or reduced costs theproject will accrue to the business. Be realistic and make sure you have someevidence for your claims. For example, a project that aims to reduce thistaxes on checkout steps by 20%. If you can pointto statistics that say 20% of customers drop out ofthe sales funnel during checkout. And that thistransl

----------------------------
1.7 UX is a process

 Design is a process.

Designing for UX is the same as designing for UI. It’s not about what you want to do, it’sabout how you can make your product better and more user-friendly.
&&


You’ll need to spend time analyzing data and you’llneed to understand the problem or set of problems we’re tryingto solve.



So, what is it that you want? What do you want from your product? And how canyou get there? The answer is: You don't have to build a product just becauseit's easy. You can build a great product if you're willing to
&&
 Design is where we solve the problem. That is; we design a solution thatwe think is going to work for our users. And part of the design processis to create a prototype, a mockup of our solution that we can test withusers to validate that it does actually solve the problem, before we goto the expensive business of building it.This is an iterative, circular process that may take a few cycles beforewe’re happy
&&


The design process is a very important part of the building’s construction. It helps to understand what you are trying to achieve, and how it will be built.
&&


The school was built. The design would have been incredibly detailed. It’s not enough tosay that we want light on the ceiling, you need to specify exactly wherethey go and what type of light fittings you want; the exact position ofthe windows and the types of material for the window frames, and so on.
&&


The design process is a bit like the game of chess. You have to know what you want, and then figure out how to get it. The architect has to do that too, but he doesn't have all the answers yet.



So we're going through this process again: I'm trying to understand what's important in my building, and I'm trying to find ways of making it better than it was before. And
&&


The design of a school is not the same as the design of a product. The experience designer needs to be able to define what it means for students and teachers to come into school every morning, how they feel about that day, and how they will feel when they leave.
&&


The product is visualised in high fidelity from the beginning.

Everybody knows what they’re building. Everybodyknows that the product is going to look like when they’re done.




&&


The process of building a product is not about the design, it’sabout the execution.
&&


UX is a business case for your product. It’s not just about the design, it’sabout how you make that design work in real life.
&&

----------------------------
1.8 Agile and UX

 Design is not a good idea in agile.

The problem with design is that it’s hard to get right, and the best way toget it right is by doing lots of experiments. The more you do them,the better they are at getting things right. But if you don’tdo them, then your code will be too complex for users to understandand therefore won’t work well for any purpose whatsoever.
&&
 Continuous deployment is a good thing.

But it’s not always easy to do this, and there are some challenges that you haveto overcome in order to make the process work for you.

So let’s take a look at how we can go about doing this.




&&


If you're going to build a waterfall project management process,you need to be very careful about the scale of your product.



The best way to avoid this is by using a more traditional approach:



1) Build up an internal team that's responsible for managing the project. Thisis important because it will help ensure that there are no surprises inthe design phase and all the work done during the prototype phase.


&&


UX is a very important part of the development process. It’s not just about getting things done, it’s also about making sure that you are doing something right and that your team is working together to get the job done.



I think this post has been well received by many people who have read it and I hope they will find some useful information in it as well.
&&


Lean UX is a process that allows you to build products faster, with less effort.

It’s not about the product or the user experience; it’s about how you design andbuild your product.


&&


The process is the process and it doesn’t change even when you arecompressing to work in an agile development environment.
&&

----------------------------
1.9 Humans are not machines

 The first book is a great read, but the second one is really good.

The first thing I want to say about this module is that it’s not just about UX. It’s alsoabout design and how we can use technology to help us solve problems in our lives. And there aregood reasons for us to do so. The reason why we need to look at both of these factorsis because they have an impact
&&


The first thing you need to know about the human brain is that it’s a very complex machine. And there are lots of different parts, and they all have their own functions. But in order for them to work together as one, they must be able to communicate with each other. This means that we can only understand what our brains want us to do if we can talk with it.

So how does this relate back
&&


The human brain is a very complex machine, and it’s not just the software that makes errors. It’s also the way we think about ourselves, our relationships with others, how we interact with technology – all of these things are incredibly complicated.

I don’t know if you can say that humans are more logical than computers or vice versa. But I do know that there is a lot of evidence to
&&
 I think that the best way to design a computer is to make it as fast and as logical as possible.

I’m not saying you should be able to do everything, but I am saying that if you can do something in a reasonable time, then you are doing something right.

1.10 The danger of features

 Telephones are complicated.

 I’m not sure if this is a good idea, but I think it’s worth trying.

I have to admit that the phone itself is pretty cool. It has a very simple design and looks like something you would find in an elementary school classroom. The only thing that makes me feel bad about using this phone is the fact that there are no buttons on the back of it, so you can’t use your
&&


The phone is a little bit more complicated than it was in the 1980s.
&&
 The MR button is a tool that can be used to make your life better.

The key thing about the MR button is that it's not just a tool, but an action. It'snot just something you do; it's something you think about and act upon every day.It's not just some piece of software or hardware; it's an action we all take on ourdays-to-days in order to improve ourselves and others
&&


-  you need to lift the handset and press the MR button, then press number of where you want to store it in sequence.

The first thing I did was put my wife's phone number on there. Then I pressed the MR button and saved her number to that particular phone. Now, if she calls me back with a new number, I can just tap the numbers again and save them all together into one big list so
&&


The problem with the feature is that it’s not a good idea to have too many features. The more you add, the more complex your interface becomes.



Second, if you want to save people from having to do this every time they call their phone number, then there are better ways of doing it than by adding new features.


&&


The Nokia N900 is a great phone, but it’s not the best phone on the market. It'sa good phone for people who want to use their phones as a mobile office or home computer. But if you're lookingfor something that can do more than just make calls and send SMS, then this isn'tthe right choice for you.


&&
 the phone with a small number of features is not complex, but the phone with a hugenumber of features is.

The design of the iPhone 5c was very simple: it had just one button on its front and no buttons at all on its back. The only thing that you could do in this case was to press the home button or the power button. This meant that you couldn’t use any other functions like messaging, calling
&&
 The Nokia is really well designed. And even though Nokia missed thesmartphone bus, they have a great track record at designing easy-to-usefeature phones.

The remote had four buttons and it was very difficult to use because ofthe small size of the buttons. The only way you could get around this was by usinga special remote control that came with your phone – which wasn’treally an option for most people who wanted
&&


The DVD player is a great product, but it’s not the best. It has some features that are really useful and others that aren’t. The price is right for what you get, but there are better options out there.
&&


The interface is not designed. It’s just thrown together with no prioritisation or organisation. The buttons are just thrown together, and the user has to figure out how to use them.

It’s like getting all the ingredients for a cake and pouring them out on your kitchen table, and claiming “this is a cake”. Of course it's not a cake, it's just a mess! And
&&


Feature design is a process of trial and error. It’s not an easy task, but it can be done.

The key to success is to have the right people in charge of your product development team. They musthave good communication skills, they must know how to work with developersand designers, they must understand what features are needed for theirproduct and why those features need to be added. The more you add newfeatures

Ask yourself these questions before adding a feature to your product.

The most famous consumer electronics and computer companies were all founded by engineers. Many consumer electronics companies were founded in the interwar years, and computer firms in the 60s and 70s.Back then the wonder of these machines must have they worked beautifullybut that they worked at all. People didn’t care how cumbersome thewashing machine was to use, because it saved them so much time andbackache compared to washing clothes by hand.
&&


The problem with the “it doesn’t matter how it works” philosophy is that it makes people feel like they have to do everything. It also causes them to lose sight of what really matters in life, which is having fun and enjoying life.

I think we can all agree that there are some things you should never do if you want to be happy or successful. But I don’t think this applies

The CD player is a great product, but it’s not perfect. It has too many features and the competition only has 20 features. The design of the product was designed to be used by engineers who are already familiar with software development tools like Eclipse or Visual Studio. This meant that there were no constraints on how much functionality could be packed into a single feature, so we had lots of options for what to pack in our CD player

The first personal computers were designed by engineers. They had to be ableto run on the computer, and they needed a lot of power. So they usedpower supplies that could handle up to 100 watts of current.

And so you had to design your ownpower supply with more capacity than what was available at the time,

 Design is a skill that can be learned, but it’s not something youcan learn overnight.

The next step in the evolution of design was to create an interface for peopleto use. The first thing we did was to make our interfaces as simple and intuitiveas possible.

1.12 Features v goals



The first returns to the topic of features, and how typically onsoftware projects we tend to focus on developing features rather thanhelping users achieve their goals.

Microsoft Word is a great tool, but it’s not the best. It’s not even close tobeing perfect.
&&


Google is eating Microsoft’s lunch in the word processing andspreadsheet market. No doubt using lots and lots of data, it has figured out 20% of features that 80% of people use. and it has created a wordprocessing tool that is streamlined and elegant and just focused on themost common, most critical tasks.

 Spotify is a great start-up, but they need to do more.

The problem with Spotify was that it didn’t have the right kind of userbase for their service.

But there wasn’t much demandfor this type of service at all, so they had to go backand try

If you have a music library, and it’s not shared with your family orfriends, then you can use the iTunes app to manage that music.



The problem is that if you don’t share your music with friends orfamily members, then they won’t be able to listen to it. And even ifyou do share it with them, they may not know howto access their own music library
&&
 Spotify is a great example of how to solve the problem.

The Spotify experiment has been successful, and it's not just because they've made it easy for people to access all the music in the world. It's also because they're making it so easy that people will pay for their service - which means more money for them. And that makes sense: if you can't afford Spotify, then you don't have any reason to listen to

 Dropbox is a great solution for file sharing, but it’s not the best way to store files.

The problem with Dropbox was that they were one-size-fits all. They had no built in backup and recovery tools, so you needed to use them yourself. And if you wanted to share large files with friends or colleagues, then you would need an external hard drive (or at least a USB stick) which could be damaged

The problem with Dropbox is that it’s not designed to solve the problems of its users. It’s designed to be a service for people who want to share files, store them and sync them. The problem is that this isn’t what most people use Dropbox for. Most people don’t have access to an internet connection at home or in their office, so they can only download files from the cloud when

1.14 Low fidelity design



Design is a process of creating something that you want to use. It's not about designing the product, it'sabout making sure that the design will work in production.



The next step is to make sure your designs are as close to what you want them to be as possible. Thisis done by using a variety of tools and techniques such as:

1.15 Low fidelity design (continued)

 BMW is creating clay models of every car it makes, and they’re not just making them for the sake of it. They want to make sure that the cars look good before they get into production.

The reason BMW does this is because automakers know that cars our highlyinteractive, highly visual products. And they want to make sure aboutthe quality of the aesthetics and quality of the interactions, beforethey commit to mass producing them.
&&


The car manufacturers are making a prototype of the product they want to make. They’ve designed it and nowthey’re validating it before they go the very expensive and irreversible business of massproducing the car.



This is why I think that we should be more concerned about how cars look, feel,and interact with each other than what their actual performance will be. Thecar makers are not going to spend millions

The process of creating a high fidelity design is the same as that of making a prototype. The difference is that in the case of prototypes, you can actually see what it will look like before you commit to building it.

Design is not a process. It’s an artform that requires the use ofa variety of tools and techniques to produce something beautiful, but itcan be done in many ways.
